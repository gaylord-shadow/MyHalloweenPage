        <h4>Pick-a-Pumpkin Party Game</h4>
        <p>This kids' party game is easy to make and fun to play. You can make it simple by allowing kids to pick a prize depending on which pumpkin they choose, or more difficult by making the goal to match two items behind the pumpkin flaps.</p>

        <h4>Candy Bucket Pong</h4>
        <p>This oversized version of the classic college party game is reimagined for family fun. To play, set up 10 plastic candy buckets in a pyramid shape on the lawn and fill each bucket with rocks or sand. Standing about 6 feet from the first bucket, players take turns trying to toss a Ping-Pong ball into the buckets, removing a bucket each time they score. The player with the most buckets at the end wins.</p>
